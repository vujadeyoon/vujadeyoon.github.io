I am a research engineer at LG Electronics, working on computer vision and machine learning.
My research interests are training a deep neural network (DNN) model for human-centric learning and computational photography
and letting people experiencing the machine intelligence.
Recently, I have been in charge of developing the data plane in the Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) to deploy developed
DNN model to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.

I received the B.S. degree in information and communication engineering from Sejong University, Seoul, South Korea
in 2016 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),
Daejeon, South Korea in 2018.

I read the [Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World](https://www.adamgrant.net/book/originals) in 2017 and
was impressed a definition of a word, `Vuja De`. The meaning of the `Vuja De` seems to indicate my role for research.
I seek to discover new things with a fresh perspective in familiar something.

    We face something familiar, but we see it with a fresh perspective that enables us to gain new insights into old problems.
